                About the Project
            </h2>
        <p>
            
            For this project we sought to analyze how and why certain types of teams are performing at a high level and how they compare to each other.
             We began by selecting teams
            in two different categories. First, we selected 4 teams that are traditionally dominant and are considered "big clubs" because of their rich history and financial
            stature. We then selected 4 teams that are "smaller" and traditionally less dominant  
            ,but are performing at a very high and unexpected level this season. Based on these sub-categories, we selected Real Madrid, Manchester City,
            Bayern Munich, and Arsenal as the 4 big teams to analyze. For the smaller teams we decided on Stuttgart, Girona, Bayer Leverkusen, and
            Aston Villa. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The specific motivations for selecting the big teams was straightforward, as they have been at the top of the soccer
            world over the last 8 years. Selection of the smaller teams was a less straightforward. This is because the terms of success for a
            small team is relative and can often mean a variety of things. In the context of this project we define success in terms of domestic league position. All 4 
            of the small teams we selected are performing at an unexpectedly high level this season. For example, Stuttgart was in a relegation
            position last year and are now third in the Bundesliga. All of the 'smaller' teams that we selected are overperforming their expected output and thus we have chosen to include them in our analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            We wanted to first give context to the differences between the two sub-categories of teams via visualizations which show their
            performance in the league over time and their financial comparasions overtime. We did this by showing the league position over 
            the last 7 seasons and also comparing their financial situations. The bulk of the data collection process was dedicated to specific player statstics which we gathered from whoscored.com (a large soccer statistics page).
             We selected players who played at least 70% of league games for the 2023/2024 season and compared them with the previous seasons key statistics. The specific statistics we
             gathered were goals, assists, key passes, and shots per game. To further explore the question of what determines why teams succeed in their respective domestic leagues we sought to offer a perspective on not just offensive statistics as noted, but also defensive statistics such as tackles and interceptions and how succesful defenders are at attempting those actions.
